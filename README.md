<summary>Guessing game</summary>

## The Rust Programming Language - Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols

This guessing game is based on the example given [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) in this book. This project uses a newer version of the [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand) library crate.

### Run the game

On a system with Rust installed, clone and go into the directory in a terminal:

Either run:

- cargo run (development version)
- cargo run --release (release version)

Development version compiles faster while release version runs faster. However for this small game difference is marginal.
